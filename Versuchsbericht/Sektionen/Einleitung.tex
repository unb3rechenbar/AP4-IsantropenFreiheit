The material-dependant isentropic exponent $\kappa$ is a central quantity in thermodynamics, being used for many equation of states for ideal gases and being an important factor for the speed of sound. In this experiment, we investigate three ways to determine $\kappa$ for different gases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item through the resonance properties of standing waves 
    \item through the methods described by Rüchhardt and Flammersfeld, and Clément and Desormers
\end{itemize}

For the specially chosen gas $CO_2$, we furthermore illustrate and test $\kappa$'s connection to the degrees of freedom of a given substance.
