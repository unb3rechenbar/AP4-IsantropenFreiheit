\subsection{Isentropic exponent}
    For each for the three gases $Ar$, $N_2$, and $CO_2$ we conduct a measurement after both Rüchhardt and Flammersfeld, and Clément and Desormers. When filling the experimental setup with each gas, it is important to wait a few minutes until the gas has filled all appropiate volumenes completely.

\subsection{Degrees of freedom}
    After removing the attached microphone from the tube, we prepare the LabVIEW-Program in order to measure in acceptable precision. We then record the surrounding noise of the laboratory and reattach the microphone to the tube. After venting the tube with $\text{CO}_2$, we start the measurement of multiple acceptable frequencies, which we determined while recording. \\

    With the addition of hot water the second part of the experiment starts: We repeat the measurement every $5\si{\degree\celsius}$ to $10\si{\degree\celsius}$, starting from boiling water temperature. To help lowering the temperature below room temperature we use ice. After finishing the measurements we empty the setup and clean it.
